Monarch Tech Test

This is an interview technical test solution for Monarch Software

Description

The program will display a grid of records (from the supplied database) which enable the user to:

Move through the records.

Search the records (for a given SKU/Title/Artist parameter).

Edit and update a record (updating the Modified date to today).

Getting Started

Extract the .bak file and restore the database, build the code solution and set the startup projects to be MVC and the Api (if needed).

Additional

I have only provided controller level tests usually I would do service and integration. However, for the sake of time I have omitted these (I have asserted that the services were called).
I have used a Clean Architecture approach as that is what I have been using in my last positions. Since on the first call it was mantioned that Dapper is used I have uswed that instead of EF.

Thanks for the opportunity and I will hopefully see you Friday.
